Descrete-event simulation

Topology:

The whole topology is divided into domains, each controller belongs to one domain only



Events:

- Sincronization. Controller has limited number of sincronizations per step (sync budget = 1)
- Flow table Intallation: NO
- Traffic simulation (init and end): at each step,  all link weights are updated by using a X distribution
- Path calculation: simulated by reading a file containg src-dst


Final step: n steps

Time-step Reward: APC all-to-all or a predefined list  of src-dst (in src domain and dst domain)
